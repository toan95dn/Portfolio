          <p>
            Hi, my name is Toan. I am currently a computer science student at UC
            San Diego. Besides studying at school, I love to expand my knowledge
            by doing side projects. <br /> <br />I can design and build
            web/desktop applications. I love to make my app interactive,
            responsive, structured, and my code quality high. Thus, sometimes, I
            spend lots of time fixing details and thinking about optimizing my
            code.
            <br />
            <br /> Now, I am looking for an internship to gain more experience
            in software development as well as team collaboration skills. I am
            curious and in love with solving problems. So, getting adapted to a
            new working environment with new technology will not be a problem.
            <br /> <br />
            Outside of coding, I love playing the guitar, especially
            fingerstyle. My favorite artist is Tommy Emanuel. Also, I work out
            every day to maintain a good lifestyle.
          </p>
