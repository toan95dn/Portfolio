    <p>
      Hi, my name is Toan. I am currently a computer science student at UC San
      Diego. Besides studying at school, I love to expand my knowledge by doing
      side projects. <br /> <br />I can design and build web/desktop
      applications. I love to make my app interactive, responsive, structured,
      and my code quality high. Thus, sometimes, I spend lots of time fixing
      details and thinking about optimizing my code.
      <br />
      <br /> Now, I am looking for an internship to gain more experience in
      software development as well as team collaboration skills. I am curious
      and in love with solving problems. So, getting adapted to a new working
      environment with new technology will not be a problem.
      <br /> <br />
      Outside of coding, I love playing the guitar, especially fingerstyle. My
      favorite artist is Tommy Emanuel. Also, I work out every day to maintain a
      good lifestyle.
    </p>
